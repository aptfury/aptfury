<b>ABOUT ME</b>

Hi, I'm Blake! <i>(he/they)</i>

A few things you might want to know about me: I'm a disabled, queer developer and, as such, an advocate for workplace diversity, disability, and LGBTQ+ communities. My biggest loves are music, almost anything horror, anime, animation, and coding. There's few things that can cheer me up quite like a mug of hot tea and a cheesy horror movie with friends.

I genuinely love coding - programming, more specifically - and have been mostly self-taught up until recently when I began taking the #100Devs Full Stack course. Right now, I'm trying to nail down what branches of programming I'm most interested in pursuing, and looking for new experiences and opportunites to hone my skills and/or learn new ones.

INTERESTS

<b>INTERESTS</b>

In terms of programming, specifically, I have two primary interests: (1) I want to learn more about back end development and software engineering; (2) I want to learn C++ and/or C# to break into game development and explore my interests and abilities there.

While I will likely be pursuing software engineering as my primary career, I'm really interested in flexing my creative muscles and seeing what kinds of games I can make. I've always loved games, but I find them to be a valuable means of self-expression and a medium in which I can tell a story and utilize my love of programming!

CURRENTLY LEARNING

<b>WHAT AM I CURRENTLY LEARNING?</b>

Great question!

I have HTML & CSS down pretty well, so my current focus is learning JavaScript and developing my skills as a programmer. I'm trying to be careful and not push myself too hard at once, so I'm keeping myself limited to only learning JavaScript at the moment. Once I have a good enough grip on that as a programmer, I plan on learning C++ so I can work on developing games in Unreal Engine, then hopefully followed by C#. I really love programming specifically when it comes to coding, and am looking forward to learning and exploring multiple languages.

It's not coding related, but I am trying to learn Japanese, too! I think I just really love languages, lol!

COLLAB GOALS

<b>COLLAB GOALS?</b>

You know I have some! I'm the kind of person who likes to take on big projects and then climb straight into the muck and mud, and doing so with a team makes it all the better! Due to disability, I've always had a hard time with socializing and putting myself out there, so collaborating with others is actually something I'm really trying to push myself to do. I want to push myself to learn how to work better with a team, gently push myself to go out and work with others more, and in general get more comfortable sharing work loads and asking for help when I need it. Collab projects seem like a great way to build up this skill, and so they're something I'm wanting to specifically pursue as I develop my programming skills.
