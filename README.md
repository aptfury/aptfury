# About Me

Hi, I'm Blake! <i>(he/they)</i>

A few things you might want to know about me: I'm a disabled, queer developer and, as such, an advocate for workplace diversity, disability, and LGBTQ+ communities. My biggest loves are music, almost anything horror, anime, animation, and coding. There's few things that can cheer me up quite like a mug of hot tea and a cheesy horror movie with friends.

I genuinely love coding - programming, more specifically. Right now, I'm trying to nail down what branches of programming I'm most interested in pursuing, and looking for new experiences and opportunities to hone my skills and/or learn new ones.

INTERESTS

### Interests

In terms of programming, specifically, I have two primary interests: (1) I want to learn more about back end development; (2) I want to learn C++ and/or C# to break into game development and explore my interests and abilities there.

While I will likely be pursuing software engineering as my primary career, I'm really interested in flexing my creative muscles and seeing what kinds of games I can make. I've always loved games, and I find them to be a valuable means of self-expression and a medium in which I can tell a story and utilize my love of programming! I'd also really like to use my software engineering talents to work on accessibility related software.

CURRENTLY LEARNING

### Currently Learning

I have HTML & CSS down pretty well, so my current focus is developing my skills as a programmer. I'm trying to be careful and not push myself too hard at once, so I'm keeping myself limited to only one language at a time. Next on the list of things to learn is C++ so I can work on developing games in Unreal Engine, then hopefully followed by C#. I really love programming, and am looking forward to learning and exploring multiple languages.

It's not coding related, but I am trying to learn Japanese, too! I think I just really love languages, lol!

COLLAB GOALS

### Collab Goals

You know I have some! I'm the kind of person who likes to take on big projects and then climb straight into the muck and mud, and doing so with a team makes it all the better! Due to disability, I've struggled with socializing and putting myself out there, so collaborating with others is actually something I'm really trying to push myself to do. I want to push myself to learn how to work better with a team, gently push myself to go out and work with others more, and in general get more comfortable sharing work loads and asking for help when I need it. Collab projects seem like a great way to build up these skills, and so they're something I'm wanting to specifically pursue as I develop my programming skills.
